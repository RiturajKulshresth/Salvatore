# Salvatore
   An app to manage all kinds of natural disasters.
### For code.fun.do++

- Imagine there is a thunderstorm coming, but due to their habit, most people won't know due to sheer ignorance.
- Moreover, due to the untrustable media, people won't take their warnings seriously.
- At Salvatore, we notify all our users in their region about a natural disaster that is going to strike them no matter their mobile data   is on or off.
- Reaching people in remote areas of the world where internet connectivity is poor is a prime motive of Salvatore

### How will we do that?

Salvatore sends alerts to all our registered users about natural disasters about to strike them.
The alert will also inform the users about how they can survive it.
We have a managing department that acquires information about all natural disasters about to occur worldwide.
The managing department will get information from various trusted sources like meteorological department, satellite images etc.
The app then receives the info from managing department and alerts the appropriate users.
Our app runs in the background and whenever it receives a message sent from our server it reads the message code and deploys an appropriate subroutine to alert the user.
It also informs the local response team about it.
At Salvatore, we believe All lives can be saved if we act on time.
